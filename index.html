        <h2 class="center">WHAT IS MONKEYPOX?</h2>
        <p>
         Monkeypox is a skin disease caused by the Monkeypox virus, which was confirmed in May 2022. Monkeypox is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus. It can spread from animals to humans, and can also spread from person to person. The initial cases were found in the UK, where the first case was detected on 6 May 2022 in an individual with travel links to Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>
         Monkeypox can cause various signs and symptoms. While it causes some people mild symptoms, it can also more severe symptoms to others which will cause them to need care in a health facility. Those at higher risk for severe disease include people who are pregnant, children and people with compromised immune systems.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, and tiredness. This is followed by the development of a rash which can last for two to three weeks. The rash can be found on the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, eyes, mouth, throat, groin, and anal regions of the body. The number of rashes can range from one to several thousand.
        </p>
         In most cases, the symptoms of monkeypox go away on their own within a few weeks. However, for some people, an infection can lead to serious health issues and even death. Newborn babies, children and people with compromised immune systems may be at risk of more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.

        <h2 class="center">MONKEYPOX VS CHICKENPOX --- WHAT"S THE DIFFERENCE?</h2>
        <p>
          Monkeypox virus may spread from animals to people through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, by handling infected animals, or through the use of products made from infected animals. Monkeypox virus can also be transmitted from mother to fetus. The virus may also spread through direct contact with an infected person or with materials that have touched them, such as clothing or linens.
        </p>
          Chicken pox on the other hand spreads easily from only infected people to others who have never had the disease or never been vaccinated. If one person is infected, up to 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. The virus spreads mainly through close contact with an infected person. A person who has had chicken pox or is vaccinated rarely gets infected again. Even if they do, their symptoms are less severe.

        <h3 id="start" class="center">What to do if you get infected?</h3>
        <p>If you are unfortunate enough to get infected with the monkeypox virus, ways you can reduce your impact on other people include:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Get Help</th>
            <th>Keep Yourself Clean</th>
            <th>Avoid Interaction With Other People</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>
               If you are infected with the monkeypox virus, get some help by visiting your nearest hospital so that the professionals can help you in any way they can.
              </p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>
                To prevent further infection from other bacteria/viruses, keep yourself clean. By keeping yourself clean, you are killing off any bacteria or virus that has touched your body. Examples of keeping yourself clean are taking a bath, brushing your teeth, etc.
              </p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>
                If possible, try to avoid interaction with other humans if you are infected, because you can get them infected too. If you need to help with something, contact the nurses or doctors as they are well-protected to avoid infecting other patients.
              </p>
            </td>

        <h2 class="center">IMPACT OF MONKEYPOX?</h2>
        <p>
          In Africa, monkeypox mainly spreads to people by infected wild animals like rodents in limited outbreaks that typically have not crossed borders. However, the illness now in Europe and North America is spreading among those with no links to animals or recent travel to Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Monkeypox infection may not be eradicable at this point. The question really is can it be contained and managed?” Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Robert Harvey Institute for Global Health, said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murphy compared the slow rollout of monkeypox mitigations to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, but said that this particular situation is even worse based on the fact that an effective therapy, and an effective and approved vaccine, already exist.

        <h2 class="center">WHAT YOU CAN DO?</h2>
        <p>If you are not infected, here's what you can do to help prevent infection for you and others around you.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Keep Yourself Clean</h3>
            <p>
              Keeping yourself clean kills off any bacteria or virus that has touched your body. Examples of keeping yourself clean are taking a bath, brushing your teeth, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Wear A Mask</h3>
            <p>
              Even though you are not infected with any virus, wearing a mask in public places is still advisable as other people may have contageous diseases.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reduce Waste</h3>
            <p>
              Certain wastes contain germs that may go into your body and make you sick. Your immune system may be busy fighting off those germs that may give some viruses or bacteria the opportunity to go into your body.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Avoid Infected People</h3>
            <p>
              Avoid any people who is infected with any virus, whether it is COVID-19, chickenpox, smallpox or monkeypox. Keeping yourself safe from any infection will do good for you.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Get Vaccinated</h3>
            <p>
              An effective vaccine against this virus already exists, so try to get it as soon as possible.
